# Analyzing the 2D Ising Model

### The 2D Ising Model is a very interesting complex system that can relate with many real life problems, for example the brain in the resting states, social behavior, airports dynamics, etc.

#### Simualating the 2D Ising Model with Monte Carlo Metropolisâ€“Hastings algorithm. (Markov Chain algorithm)
